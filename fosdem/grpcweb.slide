: Protobuf, gRPC, gRPC-Web, GopherJS
: Introduce gRPC-Web for Go
: Create simple GopherJS app with gRPC-Web
: Explore some design challenges
: Next up: Lets start with Protobuf
: 01:00

* Protobuf

: Show of hands, who's (heard of)/using protobuf?

* Protobuf

- Googles IDL
- Binary serialization format
- Backwards compatible
- Code generation
- 9 officially supported languages
- Used widely at Google, Twitter, Twitch and more

: Googles Interface Description Language, Binary serialization format, Backwards compatibility, Code generation
: Used for service-to-service communication payloads and data storage
: Fast! (20-100 times faster than XML according to Google),
: Wide official language support, including Go, C++, Java, Python + third party libraries
: (As far as I can tell, this is the best logo of protobuf that exists)
: Next up: What does it look like?
: 02:00

* Protofiles

.code protofile.proto 0,/CatToy/+4

: Go package option
: Messages
: Scalars
: Advanced features; Oneof, enum, maps, arrays, nested messages.
: Will come back to services
: Next up: What does the Go code look like?
: 02:30

* Generated Go code

.code protofile.pb.go /type CatToy/,+4
.code protofile.pb.go /GetId/,+5
.code protofile.pb.go /GetPrice/,+5

: Getters
: Struct tags
: Marshalling performed through reflection
: Gogoproto
: Next up: How use protobuf for service-service communications?
: 03:00

* gRPC

: Show of hands again, who's heard of/using gRPC?

* gRPC

- RPC protocol
- Built on HTTP/2
- Protobuf payloads
- Generate client and server stubs
- Streaming

: 04:00

* Protobuf services

.code protofile.proto

: Services map to gRPC servers and clients
: Next up: What does the generate code look like?
: 04:30

* Generated client and server interfaces

.code protofile.pb.go /type CatServerClient/,/return &catServer/+1
.code protofile.pb.go /type CatServerServer/,/}/

: Generated client
: User implements service interface
: Next up: Can we use this in the browser?
: 05:00

* gRPC-Web

: Show of hands, who's heard of gRPC-Web?

* gRPC-Web

- gRPC for the browser
- Protobuf serialization
- Server-side streaming
- Browser becomes just another gRPC client

: HTTP/2 downgrades to HTTP/1.1
: Fetch downgrades to XHR
: Go proxy package, binary
: Diagram shows both types in use
: Used in production at Improbable
: Next up: But we can't run Go in the browser?
: 06:00

* GopherJS

: Who's heard of GopherJS? Using it?

* GopherJS

- Go to JavaScript transpiler
- Supports [[https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs#what-is-supported][_nearly_]] everything
- Most of standard library tests pass
- Used by [[https://perkeep.org/][Perkeep]] (n√©e Camlistore), [[https://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/84114/question-on-how-1password-x-uses-javascript-transpiled-go-code/p1?new=1][1Password X]], [[https://savo.la/talks/gopherjs/][Ninchat]]
- Community bindings

: Transpiler written by Richard Musiol
: Updated with each Go release, Online playground
: Supports nearly whole of standard library, including goroutines
: Community bindings (react, vue, dom, websocket)
: Can generate huge files, Avoid fmt, anything that imports fmt
: Next up: So what do we get if we put all of this together?
: 07:00

* gRPC-Web for Go

: My open source project

* gRPC-Web for Go

: Browser app communications
: Browser extensions
: Electron app communications
: Custom frontends
: Next up: What does it look like?
: 08:30

* Generated GopherJS stubs

.code protofile.pb.gopherjs.go /type CatServerClient/,/NewClient/+2

: Same API as Go gRPC client
: Next up: Lets take it for a spin!
: 09:00

* Demo

: Design interface (involve audience)
: Attach JS handler to handler click, writing result of query to page
: 16:00

* Challenges

: Explore some challenges
: Next up: What JS library to use?

* What JS client to base library on

- Official pre-alpha client
- Improbable client

: Only official client available initially
: Improbable blog post (April 2017)
: 16:30

* Official pre-alpha client

Pros:

- Official client
- Google Closure compiler
- Google Closure library base

Cons:

- Incomplete
- Poor documentation
- Hard to test/debug (C++ NGINX plugin)
- Abandoned (?)

: Pros:
: Official pre-release client, Easier to compile, closure compiler, Closure library base
: Cons: Incomplete, Poorly documented, C++ nginx plugin a nightmare to build and configure for testing.
: Abandoned (?), Ultimately never got it working
: Next up: What about the Improbable client?
: 17:30

* Improbable client

Pros:

- Fully spec compliant
- Well maintained
- Well tested
- Well documented
- Proxy written in Go
- Easy to test/debug

Cons:

- Third party client
- Webpack compiler

: Spec compliant
: Well maintained, tested, and documented
: Go proxy
: Non-official client
: Webpack compiler harder than closure
: Next up: What did I decide?
: 18:30

* Solution

Use Improbable gRPC-Web client _for_ _now_

: Improbable client much easier
: Monitoring official client repository
: Next up: How to generate serialization?
: 19:00

* How to generate serialization?

- Depend on `protoc` `--js_out` output
- Duplicate logic in generator

: Depend on protoc output?
: Duplicate protobufJS generator logic?
: 19:30

* Depend on protoc JS output

Pros:

- Simpler generator
- Automatic updates

Cons:

- Poor user experience
- Hard to avoid manual edits in generated files
    # Replace top level import with global reference
    $ sed -i "s;require('google-protobuf');\$global;g" <generated_js_file_pb.js>
    # Replace any well known type imports with correct namespace
    $ sed -i -E "s;require\('google-protobuf/.*'\);\$global.proto.google.protobuf;g" <generated_js_file_pb.js>
    # Remove export statement
    $ sed -i -E "s/goog\.object\.extend\(exports, proto\..*\);$//g" <generated_js_file_pb.js>

: Less work on my end
: More easily maintainable
: Poor user experience
: Manual edits in generated files
: Next up: What about duplicating logic?
: 20:30

* Duplicate logic

Pros:

- Much improved user experience

Cons:

- More generator work
- More maintenance required
- Greater testing burden

: Far superior user experience
: More generator work required
: Greater maintenance burden
: Greater testing burden
: Next up: What did I decide?
: 21:00

* Solution

- Duplicate logic in generator
- Write bindings for ProtobufJS

.code writer.go /\/\/ Writer/,/WriteInt32/
.code reader.go /\/\/ Reader/,/ReadInt32/
.caption [[https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/protobuf/tree/master/jspb][GopherJS ProtobufJS bindings]]

: Added ProtobufJS logic to generator
: Wrote GopherJS bindings for ProtobufJS, used by generated files
: Originally chose first option, but bad user experience
: Next up: Verifying serialization?
: 21:30

* Testing package compliance

- Validate `protoc-gen-gopherjs` serialization
- Validate gRPC-Web client functionality

: Ensure all options and all types tested
: Next up: How do you test all possibilities?
: 22:00

* Test using Go gRPC Server as Oracle

: Next up: Whats next for my library?
: 23:00

* Future work

- Spin off websocket proxy package to standalone proxy
- Add gRPC headers and trailers to websocket streams
- Add more dial options, call options
- Eagerly anticipate WASM for Go

: Spin off proxy like Improbable did
: Add gRPC headers, trailers to websocket calls
: call options, dial options
: Richard Musiol working on web assembly for Go.
: Next up: What have we learned today?
: 24:00

* Conclusion

- Write your own browser app with Go and gRPC
- Integrate with existing gRPC systems
