: Hi everyone, I'm Johan, my second talk for the GLUG.
: InfoSum, data collaboration startup. Using Go for 2.5 years.
: Open Source projects, Contributed to the Go programming language.
: Blog.
: Topic: WebAssembly
: Quick overview
: 00:30

* Today we will

- Learn about WebAssembly (WASM)
- Learn to use WASM from Go
- Show what is possible today
- See what will be possible _tomorrow_

: Today we will learn
: What WebAssembly is
: Use WebAssembly with Go
: Show whats possible today
: See whats possible tomorrow
: 
: Lets start with WebAssembly
: 01:00

* WebAssembly

- Web standard
- Cross browser
- JavaScript interface

: Who's heard of WASM?
: Web standard Assembly format
: Cross browser support since early 2018
: Built for fast numerical calculations
: JavaScript interface for browser APIs and DOM manipulation
: Could eventually replace JavaScript
: 
: What to do with Go?
: 02:00

* WebAssembly for Go

- Compile Go packages to WASM
- Implemented by Richard Musiol

: Go 1.11 will ship with WASM support
: Richard Musiol, the genius behind GopherJS
: 
: So how do we use it?
: 03:00

* Server setup

- Copy necessary files
    $GOROOT/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.html
    $GOROOT/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js
- Use correct content type
.code content-type.go /contentTypeSetter/,+7

: Little bit of server setup necessary
: Copy files
: Use the correct content type
: 
: Enough theory, lets take it for a spin
: 04:00

* Go WASM examples

: Canvas demo
:
: So lets take a look at what's coming
: 10:00

* Future

- Go WASM frameworks
- Native Browser APIs
- Threading, Garbage Collection (?)
- Continual improvements

: Brian Ketelsen, others working on DOM bindings, frameworks
: Native access to JS objects, browser APIs, threading, garbage collection
: Continual improvements to JS interface
: 
: So lets wrap up
: 11:00

* We've learned

- To use WebAssymbly with Go
- What's possible with WASM today
- What we can look forward to
