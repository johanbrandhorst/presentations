: Who designed microservice with JSON/REST API surface?
: Who designed microservice with gRPC API surface?
: Wanted to design microservice with gRPC API surface?
: I'm a gRPC guy. But Johan, you say, you can't trivially inspect the message payload on the wire!
: Can we do something about that? Can we bridge this divide?
: Next up: gRPC-Gateway intro

* gRPC-Gateway

- Translates JSON/REST requests to gRPC and back
- Simple annotation in proto files
- Provides Swagger/OpenAPI generator
- Widely used within Go gRPC community (CockroachDB, CoreOS)

: The gRPC-gateway project allows you to design gRPC and REST services at the same time
: It generates a simple reverse proxy that translates on the fly
: Instrument URL paths and verbs with a simple annotation scheme
: Provides Swagger/OpenAPI generated files.
: Used by many large Go gRPC users.
: Next up: Lets see it in action!
